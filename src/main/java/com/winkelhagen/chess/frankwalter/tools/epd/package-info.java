/**
 * This package contains several classes that might prove convenient when running epd files.
 *
 * Currently two methods are forseen to interact with EPD files from FrankWalter:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Use a unit test (see the testcase for: {@link com.winkelhagen.chess.frankwalter.tools.epd.EpdReader})</li>
 *     <li>Use commandline parameters to the main program (see javadoc in {@link com.winkelhagen.chess.frankwalter.tools.epd.BestMoveProcessor})</li>
